This project provides a PasswordCheckerUtility class designed to validate passwords based on various criteria. It ensures that passwords meet length requirements, contain uppercase and lowercase letters, have at least one digit, include a special character, and do not contain invalid repeating sequences of characters. The class offers methods to check individual passwords, compare two passwords, and return a list of invalid passwords with the associated reasons for their invalidity.
